# Security Onion in the Cloud
**NOTE: The Security Onion AMI and associated scripts are still in testing, and are NOT recommended for production use.**

The following components are currently supported and are in testing:

- Security Onion AMI (AWS)
- Security Onion Terraform Configuration 

### Security Onion AMI   
The latest version available can be located under the AWS Community AMIs, titled:

`Security-Onion-16.04`   

The image is currently hosted in the following regions:

`eu-central-1`      
`eu-west-2`          
`us-east-2`      
`us-west-2`    

If using Terraform, the correct image will be pulled upon the run of `terraform apply`.

### Configuring the Security Onion AMI and VPC Traffic Mirroring with Terraform
Special thanks goes to Jonathan Johnson (@jsecurity101) and Dustin Lee (@dlee35),for their existing work on the base Terraform configuration and Security Onion additions!

By using Terraform, one can quickly spin up Security Onion in AWS, creating a dedicated VPC, security groups, Security Onion EC2 instance, interfaces, VPC mirror configuration, and monitored Ubuntu/Windows hosts (if desired), provided you have an existing AWS account.

**PLEASE NOTE**: The default size EC2 instance used by the Terraform scripts is `t3.medium`, which is the **minimum** recommended size (2 cores/4GB RAM) to use while testing Security Onion in AWS.  Given that this instance is not free-tier eligible, you or your organization may be charged by AWS as a result of using an instance of this size or VPC mirroring -- we do not charge anything for the use of the Security Onion AMI itself.

#### Clone repo
`git clone https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/securityonion-cloud
&& cd securityonion-cloud/terraform/aws`

#### Install Terraform and AWS CLI
##### Linux (recommended Ubuntu 18.04 or higher) or Mac (as root or with sudo privilieges):
`./install-terraform-awscli.sh`
##### Windows
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-windows.html#cliv2-windows-prereq   
https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html   
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1618280/where-can-i-set-path-to-make-exe-on-windows   

#### Configure AWS details
See the following for more details:   
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html#cli-quick-configuration


`aws configure` (Provide secret/access key, etc)

#### Create public/private keypair for use with instance
`ssh-keygen -b 2048 -f ~/.ssh/securityonion`

#### Get your external IP (to allow access to your AWS instance)
`dig TXT +short o-o.myaddr.l.google.com @ns1.google.com | awk -F'"' '{ print $2}'`

#### Modify config file with external IP for whitelist
Edit `terraform.tfvars` with external IP/netmask (gathered above) for whitelist 

`Ex. "192.168.1.1/32"`

#### Enable additional monitored hosts
`ubuntu_hosts` and `windows_hosts` are both set to `0` by default in `terraform.tfvars`.

You can specify up to `10` instances of each to spin up hosts that will have mirror sessions automatically created for them so they can be immediately monitored by Security Onion.  

Please note, typical AWS/EC2 infrastructure pricing still applies! 

#### Initialize Terraform
`terraform init`

#### Build VPC Infrastructure and Instance
`terraform apply --auto-approve`   

The output from this command should provide you with the public IP address of your EC2 instance.

#### SSH into instance
`ssh -i ~/.ssh/securityonion onion@$instanceip`  

#### Update
Check for updates with `soup`.

#### Run Setup   
Run setup with `sosetup-minimal` to configure Security Onion on smaller-sized instances, choosing `Suricata` as the NIDS.   

Otherwise, run setup with `sosetup` as you normally would, choosing `Suricata` as the NIDS.   

Alternatively, if you simply want to verify VXLAN traffic is being mirrored to the Security Onion sniffing interface, do something like the following once logged in:   

`ifconfig ens6 up`   
`tcpdump -nni ens6`
##### MTU
After running setup, you may also want to alter the MTU of the sniffing interface to ensure you are able to capture all traffic you are expecting.

This can be done by running the following command...

`sudo ifconfig <sniffing int> mtu 1575`

...and modifying `/etc/network/interfaces` to contain the following line at the end of the sniffing interface block:

`mtu 1575`

##### Suricata VXLAN
Enable VXLAN decap for Suricata:

`Edit /etc/nsm/<sensorname-interface/suricata.yaml`

```
vxlan
  enabled: false
```

to 

```
vxlan
  enabled: true
```
Then run:

`sudo so-nids-restart`


##### AutoMirror
New instances capable of being mirrored (Nitro-based instances) will have a mirror session created for each of their interfaces.  Existing instances can be tagged with `Mirror=True` will also be picked up and have a mirror session created for them.
This functionality is provided by the logic from [3CORESec AutoMirror](https://github.com/3CORESec/AWS-AutoMirror).

Special thanks goes to @0xtf and team for all their work with AutoMirror!

##### Tear it down
The instance and VPC configuration can quickly be destroyed with the following:   
`terraform destroy --auto-approve`
